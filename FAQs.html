   <p>Simply contact one of our offices to set up an initial consultation. During this meeting we will discuss your budget, your design needs. We will ask questions regarding yourself, your family, your preferences, household habits and hobbies, functional needs, and desired outcome for your home. All of this will lead us down the right path in defining your unique style. Our goal for every project is to realize the vision of the homeowner.</p>

   <h3>What if I don’t like what you design for me?</h3> 
   <img src="images/icon-arrow-down.svg" alt="arrow"> 
   </button>
   <p>We promise not to take it personally! Please just tell us what you don’t like and why, and we will fix it at no charge whenever possible. It does take a little extra time at the beginning of the design process to get to know your taste. If you are having trouble visualizing the final outcome of your home, we can do photorealistic 3-D renderings. These really let you “try before you buy.” We aim to make our clients very happy.</p>

   <h3>How much will my project cost?</h3> 
   <img src="images/icon-arrow-down.svg" alt="arrow"> 
   </button>
   <p>While every project is different, after over a decade in business, we can give you an accurate estimate of what you will need to spend to achieve your desired outcome. We will also work with you to create and stick to a budget based on your project’s scope of work. Some things to consider when creating a budget include how involved in the design process you want to be, how quickly you can make decisions, and if pursuing a remodel, how involved in project management you would like us to be.</p>
